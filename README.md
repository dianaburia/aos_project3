Here develops a software model of coprocessor operation with 8 registers combined into a stack. The data in the registers is provided in 754 format with different lengths of the characteristic and mantissa (set in the program, before compilation). Each option has its own small rational function of two variables (f = (a+b)/a). It was necessary to write a sequence of actions to calculate its value for given values of variables. Next, this sequence is implemented within the program (a sequence of operators is processed to calculate a function that takes into account the stack organization of registers).
